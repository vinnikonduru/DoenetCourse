A function f is just this collection of ordered pairs. Since we know each element x∈X is paired with exactly one element y∈Y, we could denote this element by y=f(x) so that the ordered pairs are denoted by (x,f(x))</p>\n\n\nYou may not find this set-of-ordered-pairs definition extremely illuminating. But, that\'s OK, as there are other ways to explain the concept of a function that may be more helpful at first. One tool for understanding functions is the function machine metaphor. Once you understand the concepts of functions better, you can always go back and try unpacking the technical definition of a function. You never know; you may end up appreciating the definition in the end.\nThe function machine metaphor\n\nWe can view a function as something that can take an object (as long as the object is in its domain) and turn it into (or map it to) a different object. We can imagine it is some machine that does this transformation. You put some object into its input funnel. If the input object fits into the funnel, then the function machine will process that object and turn it into some other object, which comes out its output chute.\n\nFunction machine\n\nIn this illustration, the inputs are spheres of various sizes (the domain presumably contains only those spheres that are small enough to fit into the funnel). The outputs are illustrated by the cubes coming out of the chute. Hence, this function transforms each sphere into a cube.\n\nWe may usually think of functions as taking numbers for inputs and spitting out numbers as outputs, but there\'s no need to take such a limited view of functions. There\'s nothing about a function machine that implies it must deal with numbers. Any collection of objects could serve as the domain or codomain, as we illustrate with examples.\nThe power of the function machine metaphor\n\nThe function machine metaphor is quite versatile and powerful. It can be used to explain many important properties of functions and concepts involving functions.\n\n    The domain: The domain is simply the set of objects that fit into the input funnel and can be processed by the function machine.\n\n    The codomain: You could think of the codomain as the set of objects that could theoretically fit out the chute.\n\n    The range: The range is the set of objects that would come out the chute if you put all the elements of the domain into the funnel.\n\n    The unique pairing: If the machine is in good condition, it should always produce an output when you put in an input. If you put in the same input multiple times, the machine should always yield the same output. In this way, each element of the domain is paired with exactly one output from the codomain.\n\n    Parameters: Parameters of a function can be viewed as dials that change the behavior of the function machine.\n\n    Composition: One can use multiple function machines to illustrate the composition of functions.\n\n    Inverse: The inverse of a function is equivalent to running the machine backwards. But, if two different input elements are transformed into the same output element, the backward function machine won\'t know which of the input elements to spit out and the inverse isn\'t defined.\n\nOf course, the function machine metaphor isn\'t perfect. A function doesn\'t actually destroy its inputs and turn them into its outputs. That\'s good when we define the mother function, so we don\'t actually turn people into their mothers.\n\nTo further explore the idea of a function, you can read some examples.','61df47211de2073443a1e9bd6d12094bbeec64bff9b1a23f42be24791d84b75e','2019-06-18 10:46:50',0,0,1),

This will give you a condition for the condition to be satisfied already in the first day.</p>\n\n<p>The SIR applet on the <xref contentid=\'discrete_sir_infectious_disease_model\'>discrete SIR infectious disease model page</xref>\n.</p></hint>\n\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<solution>\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p>The net gain in the number of infectives is\n<me>I_{t+1}-I_t = bS_tI_t - aI_t.</me>\nIf we want the number of infectives to decrease, then we need\n<me>bS_tI_t - aI_t \\lt 0,</me>\nwhich is the extinguish condition.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The extinguish condition is a weaker condition than the no-spread condition. First of all, the no-spread condition implies extinguish condition because if <m>bS_tI_t=0</m> (the no-spread condition), then the extinguish condition becomes <m>-aI_t \\lt  0</m>, which must be satisfied since all parameters are positive and we assume <m>I_t</m> to be positive.  Second, it is simple to satisfy the extinguish condition without the no-spread condition.</p>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe condition\n<me>bS_tI_t - aI_t \\lt  0</me>\ninvolves both <m>S_t</m> and <m>I_t</m>.  If <m>bS_tI_t \\gt  0</m>, then necessarily <m>I_t \\gt  0</m>.  We can divide both sides of the inequality by <m>I_t</m> to write the condition as\n<me>bS_t - a \\lt  0.</me>\nThis involves both parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and one state variable <m>S_t</m>.  One could also add <m>a</m> to both sides then divide by <m>b</m> to write the condition as\n<me>S_t \\lt  \\frac{a}{b}.</me>\n</li>\n\n<li>\nWith these values, \n<me>\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{0.1}{0.00005} = 2000.</me> \nSince \n<me>S_0 = 20,000 \\gt  2000 = \\frac{a}{b}</me>\nthe extinguish condition is not satisfied.  The condition on the initial susceptible size is that\n<me>S_0 \\lt  2000</me>\nin order for the number of infectives to decrease at the outside.  Indeed, the applet shows, for these values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, <m>I_t</m> initially decreases only when <m>S_0 \\lt  2000</m>.\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n</solution>\n','c40dbc48cd84cd31f278e69a5364ec9c2a1cb9bb62ef75fe48a4ee48183b34c7','2019-07-16 20:45:42',0,0,1),

Repeat the procedure to advance more than one time step.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, you will use your calculator to get these numbers.  Be sure, though, to keep lots of digits.  We require you keep 6 digits, but it\'s always a good idea to enter at least one more digit that we require to be one the safe side.  So, if your calculator says something like <m>6.866455078125E-05</m> or <m>6.866455078125 × 10^{-5}</m>, then go ahead and enter a number such as <c>6.8664551E-05</c> for your answer.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing: don\'t round numbers in the middle of your calculations.  Just keep all the digits your calculator has (for example by storing values in your calculator memory or recalling the previous answer and building on it).  If you round numbers from the middle of your calculations to 6 digits, the end result might be accurate to only 5 digits, given the way rounding errors can accumulate.</p>\n\n\n<paragraphs title=\"Helpful pages\">\n<ul>\n<li><xref contentid=\'solving_linear_discrete_dynamical_systems\'>Solving linear discrete dynamical systems</xref></li>\n</ul>\n</paragraphs>\n</hint>\n','e420ff3be7d5a538a678ae28203bd8b34637f673560efc4451caf0d533e87ed1','2019-07-18 11:33:45',0,0,1),

In this case, you\'d write the dynamical system as\n<me>c_{t+1} -c_t = c_t \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2, \\ldots.</me>\nThis dynamical system is exactly the same as the previous version, as you can add <m>c_t</m> to both sides to get to <m>c_{t+1}=2c_t</m>.</p>\n\n<p>To completely specify the dynamical system, we need an initial condition, such as specifying <m>c_0</m> the number of cells in day 0.

At what time did the bacteria fill all four beakers?\n<answer name=\'answer10\' size=\'8\'>\n<mathinput name=\"answer10_input\" prefill=\"99:99 AM\"/> \n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><if><ref prop=\"value\">answer10_input</ref> = <ref>time_quad</ref></if></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n\n<hint>\nThinking about the doubling time could be helpful.\n</hint>\n\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<solution>\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>t=</m> time in minutes.  Let <m>b_t=</m> the population size of the bacteria in minute <m>t</m>.  Given that the increase from time <m>t</m> to time <m>t+1</m> is <m>0.1487</m> times the population size at time <m>t</m>, the dynamical system model is\n<me>b_{t+1}-b_t = 0.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me></p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>By adding <m>b_t</m> to both size, we can rewrite the dynamical system as\n<me>b_{t+1} = 1.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me>\nGiven that the population size is multiplied by 1.1487 each time step, the solution is \n<me>b_t = 1.1487^t b_0.</me>\nThe population size doubles when <m>1.1487^t = 2</m>, i.e., when</p>\n<md>\n  <mrow>t=T_{\\text{double}}\\amp = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 1.1487}</mrow>\n  <mrow>\\amp \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.1386} \\approx 5.</mrow>\n</md>\n<p>Therefore, the bacteria population size doubles every 5 minutes.  We used the natural log to calculate the numbers in the fraction, but you would get the same result if you used any other base for the logarithm.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If the population continues to grow at this rate for one hour, or sixty minutes, the population increases by the factor <m>1.1487^{60} \\approx 4096</m>, which is the same as doubling about <m>60/5=12</m> times.  In two hours, the population size doubles about 24 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{120} \\approx 1.678 \\times 10^7</m>, which is about 16.78 million.  In four hours, the population size doubles about 48 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{240} \\approx 2.816 \\times 10^{14}</m>, which is about 28.16 trillion.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>b_t</m> measure the bacteria population size in units of the volume of the beaker, so that <m>b_t=1</m> means the beaker is exactly full.  If <m>t</m> is minutes after midnight, then the initial conditions are <m>b_0=5.959 \\times 10^{-8}</m>.  As a double check, we can calculate the population size at 2 AM, when <m>t=120</m>.  By our solution formula, <me>b_{120} = 1.1487^{120} \\cdot 5.959 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 1.</me>  Indeed, the beaker is exactly full at 2 AM.</p>\n\n<p>However, this calculation was just optional, as the problem didn\'t ask us to calculate that the bacteria completely fill the beaker after two hours.  We could have taken that for granted.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the beaker was full at 2 AM, the beaker was half full exactly one doubling time <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> before 2 AM.  Since we calculated that <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> was 5 minutes, the beaker was half full at 5 minutes to 2:00, or 1:55 AM.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The bacteria filled one beaker at 2 AM.  To fill four beakers, they just need to double two more times.  The bacteria fill all four beakers after two doubling times, <m>2T_{\\text{double}}</m>, or 10 minutes, i.e., at 2:10 AM.  Not much time was gained by quadrupling the available space.</p>\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n</solution>\n\n','5676a3f5e61d43d464ab0626de784b2c6ccc3e69af1f603b772c091274eeabac','2019-07-20 23:44:14',0,0,1),

Let\'s begin by reviewing the the analytic approach to finding its equilibria.  (Analytic approach means manipulating equations.)  Then, we\'ll introduce a graphical approach to finding the equilibria.\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p><em>Analytic equilibria.</em> Equilibria are values of <m>q_t</m> where <m>f(q_t)=q_t</m>, i.e., find values of <m>q_t</m> that when plugged into the function <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m>, we get <m>q_t</m> back out again.   The values <m>q_t</m> must satisfy the equation\n<me>q_t^2 - q_t = q_t.</me>  \nTo stress that we are talking about equilibria, let\'s substitute <m>E</m> for <m>q_t</m>, so the equation becomes\n<answer name=\'answer1\' size=\'20\'>\n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><math simplify=\'full\'>E^2- E=E</math></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n<p>One thing we <alert>cannot</alert> do is divide both sides of the equation by <m>E</m>.

Well, here is the <alert>wrong, incorrect, bad, invalid</alert> thing to do: divide both sides of the equation by <m>E</m>.  Why is that bad?  Is it OK to divide both sides of an equation by zero?  Could <m>E</m> be zero?  Only divide both sides of an equation by a variable such as <m>E</m> if you know that the variable cannot be zero.  If you divide both sides by <m>E</m>, you get <m>1=\\frac{1}{2}</m>, which cannot be true no matter what value you try for <m>E</m> (duh!).

When you plug in <m>y_t = E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, the left hand side is <m>E-E</m>, i.e., it is zero.  The change in time (the difference) is always zero at an equilibrium, so you\'ll always get this simple result when in difference form.  However, you still have to think, because if you have function iteration form and you casually set the left hand side to zero, you won\'t be finding equilibria.  (Instead you\'ll find the points that go to zero in the next time step -- not such a useful result.)\n\n<p>When you plug in <m>y_t=E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, you should get <m>0=2E(1-E)</m>.

Even after that, though, you do not have a product of factors set equal to zero.  The factored form does not help anymore once you subtract <m>E</m> from both sides.

A function f is just this collection of ordered pairs. Since we know each element x∈X is paired with exactly one element y∈Y, we could denote this element by y=f(x) so that the ordered pairs are denoted by (x,f(x))</p>\n\n\nYou may not find this set-of-ordered-pairs definition extremely illuminating. But, that\'s OK, as there are other ways to explain the concept of a function that may be more helpful at first. One tool for understanding functions is the function machine metaphor. Once you understand the concepts of functions better, you can always go back and try unpacking the technical definition of a function. You never know; you may end up appreciating the definition in the end.\nThe function machine metaphor\n\nWe can view a function as something that can take an object (as long as the object is in its domain) and turn it into (or map it to) a different object. We can imagine it is some machine that does this transformation. You put some object into its input funnel. If the input object fits into the funnel, then the function machine will process that object and turn it into some other object, which comes out its output chute.\n\nFunction machine\n\nIn this illustration, the inputs are spheres of various sizes (the domain presumably contains only those spheres that are small enough to fit into the funnel). The outputs are illustrated by the cubes coming out of the chute. Hence, this function transforms each sphere into a cube.\n\nWe may usually think of functions as taking numbers for inputs and spitting out numbers as outputs, but there\'s no need to take such a limited view of functions. There\'s nothing about a function machine that implies it must deal with numbers. Any collection of objects could serve as the domain or codomain, as we illustrate with examples.\nThe power of the function machine metaphor\n\nThe function machine metaphor is quite versatile and powerful. It can be used to explain many important properties of functions and concepts involving functions.\n\n    The domain: The domain is simply the set of objects that fit into the input funnel and can be processed by the function machine.\n\n    The codomain: You could think of the codomain as the set of objects that could theoretically fit out the chute.\n\n    The range: The range is the set of objects that would come out the chute if you put all the elements of the domain into the funnel.\n\n    The unique pairing: If the machine is in good condition, it should always produce an output when you put in an input. If you put in the same input multiple times, the machine should always yield the same output. In this way, each element of the domain is paired with exactly one output from the codomain.\n\n    Parameters: Parameters of a function can be viewed as dials that change the behavior of the function machine.\n\n    Composition: One can use multiple function machines to illustrate the composition of functions.\n\n    Inverse: The inverse of a function is equivalent to running the machine backwards. But, if two different input elements are transformed into the same output element, the backward function machine won\'t know which of the input elements to spit out and the inverse isn\'t defined.\n\nOf course, the function machine metaphor isn\'t perfect. A function doesn\'t actually destroy its inputs and turn them into its outputs. That\'s good when we define the mother function, so we don\'t actually turn people into their mothers.\n\nTo further explore the idea of a function, you can read some examples.','61df47211de2073443a1e9bd6d12094bbeec64bff9b1a23f42be24791d84b75e','2019-06-18 10:46:50',1,0,1),

When you vaccinated enough people, the disease should have stopped without the susceptibles going to zero.  Instead, what caused the disease to stop?

The disease was as bad as it could be, infecting everyone, as the number of recovered approaches the size of the population. </p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The parameter <m>b</m> controls the rate that susceptible people get sick.  If we decrease <m>b</m>, people should get sick more slowly and the outcome of the disease should be less severe.  Roughly, a value of <m>b</m> between <m>1.5 \\times 10^{-5}</m> and zero should work. When <m>b</m> is that small, there is a large difference in the results.  Unlike when <m>b=0.00005</m>, not everyone gets sick.  Even after a long time, the number of suceptibles does not go to zero, and the number of recovered does not go to the total population size.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If <m>b</m> is too large, then such as <m>b=0.0001</m>, then the number of susceptible individuals becomes negative, which doesn\'t make sense.  This happens because <m>bS_tI_t</m> becomes larger than <m>S_t</m> if <m>bI_t \\gt  1</m>.   According to the equation, more people get sick in a day than are susceptible.</p>\n\n<p>It also doesn\'t make sense to let <m>b</m> get negative, so that a negative number of people get sick in a day.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe parameter <m>a</m> determine the recovery rate, i.e., the number of people that recover: <m>aI_t</m>.  So, when <m>a</m> gets smaller, people stay infected longer, and the disease is worse.  Conversely, when <m>a</m> gets large, people recover faster, and the course of the disease is less severe.\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If a drug helped healthy people fight off an infection, it would decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>If a drug helped sick people recover more quickly, it would increase parameter <m>a</m>.</p>\n\n<p>A policy that quickly quarantined sick people is trying to decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>One goal educating people to avoid practices that spread infection is to decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>All else being equal, a disease in which infected people died quickly (and were promptly buried or cremated) would correspond to a disease with a large value of the parameter <m>a</m>.  Therefore, it would likely lead to a smaller spread of the disease among the population, compared to a disease where infected people died more slowly.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Another way to control the spread of a disease is through vaccinations.  When you vaccinate people, you decrease the number of susceptible people.</p>\n\n\n<p>If we vaccinated all the people, i.e., set <m>V=20,000</m>, then the initial number of susceptible people would be <m>S_0 = 0</m>.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate half the people, i.e. set <m>V=10,000</m> so that <m>S_0 = <ref>ten_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><ref>S_end1</ref></m>, which is about <m><ref>P_end1</ref></m>%, of the original susceptible folks avoid getting sick.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate <m>V=15,000</m> individuals so that <m>S_0 =<ref>five_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>S_end2</ref></round></m> people avoid getting sick in the end, which represents about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>P_end2</ref></round></m>% of the original susceptibles.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate <m>V=19,000</m> individuals so that <m>S_0 =<ref>one_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><ref>S_end3</ref></m> people avoid getting sick in the end, which represents about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>P_end3</ref></round></m>% of the original susceptibles. </p>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe disease stops because the number of infecteds drops to zero.  With no one to infect them, the remaining susceptibles do not get sick.

Repeat the procedure to advance more than one time step.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, you will use your calculator to get these numbers.  Be sure, though, to keep lots of digits.  We require you keep 6 digits, but it\'s always a good idea to enter at least one more digit that we require to be one the safe side.  So, if your calculator says something like <m>6.866455078125E-05</m> or <m>6.866455078125 × 10^{-5}</m>, then go ahead and enter a number such as <c>6.8664551E-05</c> for your answer.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing: don\'t round numbers in the middle of your calculations.  Just keep all the digits your calculator has (for example by storing values in your calculator memory or recalling the previous answer and building on it).  If you round numbers from the middle of your calculations to 6 digits, the end result might be accurate to only 5 digits, given the way rounding errors can accumulate.</p>\n\n\n<paragraphs title=\"Helpful pages\">\n<ul>\n<li><xref contentid=\'solving_linear_discrete_dynamical_systems\'>Solving linear discrete dynamical systems</xref></li>\n</ul>\n</paragraphs>\n</hint>\n','e420ff3be7d5a538a678ae28203bd8b34637f673560efc4451caf0d533e87ed1','2019-07-18 11:33:45',1,0,1),

In this case, you\'d write the dynamical system as\n<me>c_{t+1} -c_t = c_t \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2, \\ldots.</me>\nThis dynamical system is exactly the same as the previous version, as you can add <m>c_t</m> to both sides to get to <m>c_{t+1}=2c_t</m>.</p>\n\n<p>To completely specify the dynamical system, we need an initial condition, such as specifying <m>c_0</m> the number of cells in day 0.

At what time did the bacteria fill all four beakers?\n<answer name=\'answer10\' size=\'8\'>\n<mathinput name=\"answer10_input\" prefill=\"99:99 AM\"/> \n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><if><ref prop=\"value\">answer10_input</ref> = <ref>time_quad</ref></if></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n\n<hint>\nThinking about the doubling time could be helpful.\n</hint>\n\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<solution>\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>t=</m> time in minutes.  Let <m>b_t=</m> the population size of the bacteria in minute <m>t</m>.  Given that the increase from time <m>t</m> to time <m>t+1</m> is <m>0.1487</m> times the population size at time <m>t</m>, the dynamical system model is\n<me>b_{t+1}-b_t = 0.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me></p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>By adding <m>b_t</m> to both size, we can rewrite the dynamical system as\n<me>b_{t+1} = 1.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me>\nGiven that the population size is multiplied by 1.1487 each time step, the solution is \n<me>b_t = 1.1487^t b_0.</me>\nThe population size doubles when <m>1.1487^t = 2</m>, i.e., when</p>\n<md>\n  <mrow>t=T_{\\text{double}}\\amp = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 1.1487}</mrow>\n  <mrow>\\amp \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.1386} \\approx 5.</mrow>\n</md>\n<p>Therefore, the bacteria population size doubles every 5 minutes.  We used the natural log to calculate the numbers in the fraction, but you would get the same result if you used any other base for the logarithm.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If the population continues to grow at this rate for one hour, or sixty minutes, the population increases by the factor <m>1.1487^{60} \\approx 4096</m>, which is the same as doubling about <m>60/5=12</m> times.  In two hours, the population size doubles about 24 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{120} \\approx 1.678 \\times 10^7</m>, which is about 16.78 million.  In four hours, the population size doubles about 48 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{240} \\approx 2.816 \\times 10^{14}</m>, which is about 28.16 trillion.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>b_t</m> measure the bacteria population size in units of the volume of the beaker, so that <m>b_t=1</m> means the beaker is exactly full.  If <m>t</m> is minutes after midnight, then the initial conditions are <m>b_0=5.959 \\times 10^{-8}</m>.  As a double check, we can calculate the population size at 2 AM, when <m>t=120</m>.  By our solution formula, <me>b_{120} = 1.1487^{120} \\cdot 5.959 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 1.</me>  Indeed, the beaker is exactly full at 2 AM.</p>\n\n<p>However, this calculation was just optional, as the problem didn\'t ask us to calculate that the bacteria completely fill the beaker after two hours.  We could have taken that for granted.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the beaker was full at 2 AM, the beaker was half full exactly one doubling time <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> before 2 AM.  Since we calculated that <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> was 5 minutes, the beaker was half full at 5 minutes to 2:00, or 1:55 AM.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The bacteria filled one beaker at 2 AM.  To fill four beakers, they just need to double two more times.  The bacteria fill all four beakers after two doubling times, <m>2T_{\\text{double}}</m>, or 10 minutes, i.e., at 2:10 AM.  Not much time was gained by quadrupling the available space.</p>\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n</solution>\n\n','5676a3f5e61d43d464ab0626de784b2c6ccc3e69af1f603b772c091274eeabac','2019-07-20 23:44:14',1,0,1),

Let\'s begin by reviewing the the analytic approach to finding its equilibria.  (Analytic approach means manipulating equations.)  Then, we\'ll introduce a graphical approach to finding the equilibria.\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p><em>Analytic equilibria.</em> Equilibria are values of <m>q_t</m> where <m>f(q_t)=q_t</m>, i.e., find values of <m>q_t</m> that when plugged into the function <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m>, we get <m>q_t</m> back out again.   The values <m>q_t</m> must satisfy the equation\n<me>q_t^2 - q_t = q_t.</me>  \nTo stress that we are talking about equilibria, let\'s substitute <m>E</m> for <m>q_t</m>, so the equation becomes\n<answer name=\'answer1\' size=\'20\'>\n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><math simplify=\'full\'>E^2- E=E</math></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n<p>One thing we <alert>cannot</alert> do is divide both sides of the equation by <m>E</m>.

Well, here is the <alert>wrong, incorrect, bad, invalid</alert> thing to do: divide both sides of the equation by <m>E</m>.  Why is that bad?  Is it OK to divide both sides of an equation by zero?  Could <m>E</m> be zero?  Only divide both sides of an equation by a variable such as <m>E</m> if you know that the variable cannot be zero.  If you divide both sides by <m>E</m>, you get <m>1=\\frac{1}{2}</m>, which cannot be true no matter what value you try for <m>E</m> (duh!).

When you plug in <m>y_t = E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, the left hand side is <m>E-E</m>, i.e., it is zero.  The change in time (the difference) is always zero at an equilibrium, so you\'ll always get this simple result when in difference form.  However, you still have to think, because if you have function iteration form and you casually set the left hand side to zero, you won\'t be finding equilibria.  (Instead you\'ll find the points that go to zero in the next time step -- not such a useful result.)\n\n<p>When you plug in <m>y_t=E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, you should get <m>0=2E(1-E)</m>.

Even after that, though, you do not have a product of factors set equal to zero.  The factored form does not help anymore once you subtract <m>E</m> from both sides.

(You can see light gray lines that extend each line and show the intersection.)  Exploiting this fact, we can, after moving vertically to the graph of <m>f</m> to find the output value, draw a horizontal line to the diagonal rather than to the vertical axis.

Here\'s one way to remember.\n    \n    <p>When you graph a function <m>f(x)</m> and you want to look up the value of, say <m>f(3)</m> from the graph, you start at <m>x=3</m> and move \n    <answer name=\'answer8\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     until you hit the graph.  The height of the graph at that point is the value of <m>f(3)</m>.  In other words, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer9\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the natural thing to do when looking up function values.  When you are cobwebbing and moving vertically, you should always stop when you hit the \n    <answer name=\'answer10\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the function</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .</p>\n    \n    <p>On the other hand, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer11\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>horizontally</choice>\n    <choice>vertically</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the strange part.

(You can see light gray lines that extend each line and show the intersection.)  Exploiting this fact, we can, after moving vertically to the graph of <m>f</m> to find the output value, draw a horizontal line to the diagonal rather than to the vertical axis.  The point on the diagonal gives our next horizontal position, so we can simply move vertically to the graph of <m>f</m> again to find the next value of <m>x</m>.</p>\n    \n    <p>This procedure works because moving horizontally to the diagonal (i.e., the line where <m>x_{n+1}=x_{n}</m>) makes your horizontal position match your vertical position, which was the output value of the previous step.</p>\n    \n    <p>Verify that this procedure works on the below graph by calculating <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>, starting with the initial condition <m>x_0=<ref>x0</ref></m>.

Here\'s one way to remember.\n    \n    <p>When you graph a function <m>f(x)</m> and you want to look up the value of, say <m>f(3)</m> from the graph, you start at <m>x=3</m> and move \n    <answer name=\'answer8\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     until you hit the graph.  The height of the graph at that point is the value of <m>f(3)</m>.  In other words, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer9\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the natural thing to do when looking up function values.  When you are cobwebbing and moving vertically, you should always stop when you hit the \n    <answer name=\'answer10\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the function</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .</p>\n    \n    <p>On the other hand, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer11\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>horizontally</choice>\n    <choice>vertically</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the strange part.  And, the new line that we plot with cobwebbing is the \n    <answer name=\'answer12\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the function</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .  If you associate those two strange additions together, you will remember that, during cobwebbing, when moving horizontally, you should stop when you hit the \n    <answer name=\'answer13\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the function</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .</p>\n    \n    \n    </li>\n    \n    \n    </ol>\n    \n    \n    <solution>\n    \n    \n    <ol>\n    \n    <li>\n    The equilibria are <m>E=-2,0,2</m>.\n    </li>\n    \n    <li>\n    <ol>\n    <li><m>x_0=1</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-1</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=3</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-3</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=3.75</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-3.75</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    </ol>\n    \n    </li>\n    \n    <li>\n    \n    </li>\n    \n    \n    </ol>\n    \n    </solution>\n    \n    \n    </problem>','216d559cc3e42bc85d59ed3c99b098e8b69d1dddac88a5f06c0520c0fdefe332','2019-08-20 09:58:12',0,0,1),

A function f is just this collection of ordered pairs. Since we know each element x∈X is paired with exactly one element y∈Y, we could denote this element by y=f(x) so that the ordered pairs are denoted by (x,f(x))</p>\n\n\nYou may not find this set-of-ordered-pairs definition extremely illuminating. But, that\'s OK, as there are other ways to explain the concept of a function that may be more helpful at first. One tool for understanding functions is the function machine metaphor. Once you understand the concepts of functions better, you can always go back and try unpacking the technical definition of a function. You never know; you may end up appreciating the definition in the end.\nThe function machine metaphor\n\nWe can view a function as something that can take an object (as long as the object is in its domain) and turn it into (or map it to) a different object. We can imagine it is some machine that does this transformation. You put some object into its input funnel. If the input object fits into the funnel, then the function machine will process that object and turn it into some other object, which comes out its output chute.\n\nFunction machine\n\nIn this illustration, the inputs are spheres of various sizes (the domain presumably contains only those spheres that are small enough to fit into the funnel). The outputs are illustrated by the cubes coming out of the chute. Hence, this function transforms each sphere into a cube.\n\nWe may usually think of functions as taking numbers for inputs and spitting out numbers as outputs, but there\'s no need to take such a limited view of functions. There\'s nothing about a function machine that implies it must deal with numbers. Any collection of objects could serve as the domain or codomain, as we illustrate with examples.\nThe power of the function machine metaphor\n\nThe function machine metaphor is quite versatile and powerful. It can be used to explain many important properties of functions and concepts involving functions.\n\n    The domain: The domain is simply the set of objects that fit into the input funnel and can be processed by the function machine.\n\n    The codomain: You could think of the codomain as the set of objects that could theoretically fit out the chute.\n\n    The range: The range is the set of objects that would come out the chute if you put all the elements of the domain into the funnel.\n\n    The unique pairing: If the machine is in good condition, it should always produce an output when you put in an input. If you put in the same input multiple times, the machine should always yield the same output. In this way, each element of the domain is paired with exactly one output from the codomain.\n\n    Parameters: Parameters of a function can be viewed as dials that change the behavior of the function machine.\n\n    Composition: One can use multiple function machines to illustrate the composition of functions.\n\n    Inverse: The inverse of a function is equivalent to running the machine backwards. But, if two different input elements are transformed into the same output element, the backward function machine won\'t know which of the input elements to spit out and the inverse isn\'t defined.\n\nOf course, the function machine metaphor isn\'t perfect. A function doesn\'t actually destroy its inputs and turn them into its outputs. That\'s good when we define the mother function, so we don\'t actually turn people into their mothers.\n\nTo further explore the idea of a function, you can read some examples.','2019-06-18 10:46:50','2019-06-18 10:36:55',0,'61df47211de2073443a1e9bd6d12094bbeec64bff9b1a23f42be24791d84b75e',0),

The disease was as bad as it could be, infecting everyone, as the number of recovered approaches the size of the population. </p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The parameter <m>b</m> controls the rate that susceptible people get sick.  If we decrease <m>b</m>, people should get sick more slowly and the outcome of the disease should be less severe.  Roughly, a value of <m>b</m> between <m>1.5 \\times 10^{-5}</m> and zero should work. When <m>b</m> is that small, there is a large difference in the results.  Unlike when <m>b=0.00005</m>, not everyone gets sick.  Even after a long time, the number of suceptibles does not go to zero, and the number of recovered does not go to the total population size.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If <m>b</m> is too large, then such as <m>b=0.0001</m>, then the number of susceptible individuals becomes negative, which doesn\'t make sense.  This happens because <m>bS_tI_t</m> becomes larger than <m>S_t</m> if <m>bI_t \\gt  1</m>.   According to the equation, more people get sick in a day than are susceptible.</p>\n\n<p>It also doesn\'t make sense to let <m>b</m> get negative, so that a negative number of people get sick in a day.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe parameter <m>a</m> determine the recovery rate, i.e., the number of people that recover: <m>aI_t</m>.  So, when <m>a</m> gets smaller, people stay infected longer, and the disease is worse.  Conversely, when <m>a</m> gets large, people recover faster, and the course of the disease is less severe.\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If a drug helped healthy people fight off an infection, it would decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>If a drug helped sick people recover more quickly, it would increase parameter <m>a</m>.</p>\n\n<p>A policy that quickly quarantined sick people is trying to decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>One goal educating people to avoid practices that spread infection is to decrease parameter <m>b</m>.</p>\n\n<p>All else being equal, a disease in which infected people died quickly (and were promptly buried or cremated) would correspond to a disease with a large value of the parameter <m>a</m>.  Therefore, it would likely lead to a smaller spread of the disease among the population, compared to a disease where infected people died more slowly.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Another way to control the spread of a disease is through vaccinations.  When you vaccinate people, you decrease the number of susceptible people.</p>\n\n\n<p>If we vaccinated all the people, i.e., set <m>V=20,000</m>, then the initial number of susceptible people would be <m>S_0 = 0</m>.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate half the people, i.e. set <m>V=10,000</m> so that <m>S_0 = <ref>ten_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><ref>S_end1</ref></m>, which is about <m><ref>P_end1</ref></m>%, of the original susceptible folks avoid getting sick.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate <m>V=15,000</m> individuals so that <m>S_0 =<ref>five_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>S_end2</ref></round></m> people avoid getting sick in the end, which represents about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>P_end2</ref></round></m>% of the original susceptibles.</p>\n\n<p>If you vaccinate <m>V=19,000</m> individuals so that <m>S_0 =<ref>one_thousand</ref></m>, about <m><ref>S_end3</ref></m> people avoid getting sick in the end, which represents about <m><round numberdecimals=\"0\"><ref>P_end3</ref></round></m>% of the original susceptibles. </p>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\nThe disease stops because the number of infecteds drops to zero.  With no one to infect them, the remaining susceptibles do not get sick.

Repeat the procedure to advance more than one time step.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, you will use your calculator to get these numbers.  Be sure, though, to keep lots of digits.  We require you keep 6 digits, but it\'s always a good idea to enter at least one more digit that we require to be one the safe side.  So, if your calculator says something like <m>6.866455078125E-05</m> or <m>6.866455078125 × 10^{-5}</m>, then go ahead and enter a number such as <c>6.8664551E-05</c> for your answer.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing: don\'t round numbers in the middle of your calculations.  Just keep all the digits your calculator has (for example by storing values in your calculator memory or recalling the previous answer and building on it).  If you round numbers from the middle of your calculations to 6 digits, the end result might be accurate to only 5 digits, given the way rounding errors can accumulate.</p>\n\n\n<paragraphs title=\"Helpful pages\">\n<ul>\n<li><xref contentid=\'solving_linear_discrete_dynamical_systems\'>Solving linear discrete dynamical systems</xref></li>\n</ul>\n</paragraphs>\n</hint>\n','2019-07-18 11:33:45','2019-07-18 11:24:58',0,'e420ff3be7d5a538a678ae28203bd8b34637f673560efc4451caf0d533e87ed1',0),

In this case, you\'d write the dynamical system as\n<me>c_{t+1} -c_t = c_t \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2, \\ldots.</me>\nThis dynamical system is exactly the same as the previous version, as you can add <m>c_t</m> to both sides to get to <m>c_{t+1}=2c_t</m>.</p>\n\n<p>To completely specify the dynamical system, we need an initial condition, such as specifying <m>c_0</m> the number of cells in day 0.

At what time did the bacteria fill all four beakers?\n<answer name=\'answer10\' size=\'8\'>\n<mathinput name=\"answer10_input\" prefill=\"99:99 AM\"/> \n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><if><ref prop=\"value\">answer10_input</ref> = <ref>time_quad</ref></if></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n\n<hint>\nThinking about the doubling time could be helpful.\n</hint>\n\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<solution>\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>t=</m> time in minutes.  Let <m>b_t=</m> the population size of the bacteria in minute <m>t</m>.  Given that the increase from time <m>t</m> to time <m>t+1</m> is <m>0.1487</m> times the population size at time <m>t</m>, the dynamical system model is\n<me>b_{t+1}-b_t = 0.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me></p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>By adding <m>b_t</m> to both size, we can rewrite the dynamical system as\n<me>b_{t+1} = 1.1487 b_t, \\quad \\text{for } t=0,1,2,3 \\ldots</me>\nGiven that the population size is multiplied by 1.1487 each time step, the solution is \n<me>b_t = 1.1487^t b_0.</me>\nThe population size doubles when <m>1.1487^t = 2</m>, i.e., when</p>\n<md>\n  <mrow>t=T_{\\text{double}}\\amp = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 1.1487}</mrow>\n  <mrow>\\amp \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.1386} \\approx 5.</mrow>\n</md>\n<p>Therefore, the bacteria population size doubles every 5 minutes.  We used the natural log to calculate the numbers in the fraction, but you would get the same result if you used any other base for the logarithm.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>If the population continues to grow at this rate for one hour, or sixty minutes, the population increases by the factor <m>1.1487^{60} \\approx 4096</m>, which is the same as doubling about <m>60/5=12</m> times.  In two hours, the population size doubles about 24 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{120} \\approx 1.678 \\times 10^7</m>, which is about 16.78 million.  In four hours, the population size doubles about 48 times, increasing by a factor of <m>1.1487^{240} \\approx 2.816 \\times 10^{14}</m>, which is about 28.16 trillion.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Let <m>b_t</m> measure the bacteria population size in units of the volume of the beaker, so that <m>b_t=1</m> means the beaker is exactly full.  If <m>t</m> is minutes after midnight, then the initial conditions are <m>b_0=5.959 \\times 10^{-8}</m>.  As a double check, we can calculate the population size at 2 AM, when <m>t=120</m>.  By our solution formula, <me>b_{120} = 1.1487^{120} \\cdot 5.959 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 1.</me>  Indeed, the beaker is exactly full at 2 AM.</p>\n\n<p>However, this calculation was just optional, as the problem didn\'t ask us to calculate that the bacteria completely fill the beaker after two hours.  We could have taken that for granted.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the beaker was full at 2 AM, the beaker was half full exactly one doubling time <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> before 2 AM.  Since we calculated that <m>T_{\\text{double}}</m> was 5 minutes, the beaker was half full at 5 minutes to 2:00, or 1:55 AM.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>The bacteria filled one beaker at 2 AM.  To fill four beakers, they just need to double two more times.  The bacteria fill all four beakers after two doubling times, <m>2T_{\\text{double}}</m>, or 10 minutes, i.e., at 2:10 AM.  Not much time was gained by quadrupling the available space.</p>\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n\n</solution>\n\n','2019-07-20 23:44:14','2019-07-20 23:37:31',0,'5676a3f5e61d43d464ab0626de784b2c6ccc3e69af1f603b772c091274eeabac',0),

Let\'s begin by reviewing the the analytic approach to finding its equilibria.  (Analytic approach means manipulating equations.)  Then, we\'ll introduce a graphical approach to finding the equilibria.\n\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>\n<p><em>Analytic equilibria.</em> Equilibria are values of <m>q_t</m> where <m>f(q_t)=q_t</m>, i.e., find values of <m>q_t</m> that when plugged into the function <m>f(x)=x^2-x</m>, we get <m>q_t</m> back out again.   The values <m>q_t</m> must satisfy the equation\n<me>q_t^2 - q_t = q_t.</me>  \nTo stress that we are talking about equilibria, let\'s substitute <m>E</m> for <m>q_t</m>, so the equation becomes\n<answer name=\'answer1\' size=\'20\'>\n<award symbolicEquality=\'true\'><math simplify=\'full\'>E^2- E=E</math></award>\n</answer>\n</p>\n\n<p>One thing we <alert>cannot</alert> do is divide both sides of the equation by <m>E</m>.

Could <m>E</m> be zero?  Only divide both sides of an equation by a variable such as <m>E</m> if you know that the variable cannot be zero.

When you plug in <m>y_t = E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, the left hand side is <m>E-E</m>, i.e., it is zero.  The change in time (the difference) is always zero at an equilibrium, so you\'ll always get this simple result when in difference form.  However, you still have to think, because if you have function iteration form and you casually set the left hand side to zero, you won\'t be finding equilibria.  (Instead you\'ll find the points that go to zero in the next time step -- not such a useful result.)\n\n<p>When you plug in <m>y_t=E</m> and <m>y_{t+1}=E</m>, you should get <m>0=2E(1-E)</m>.

(You can see light gray lines that extend each line and show the intersection.)  Exploiting this fact, we can, after moving vertically to the graph of <m>f</m> to find the output value, draw a horizontal line to the diagonal rather than to the vertical axis.  The point on the diagonal gives our next horizontal position, so we can simply move vertically to the graph of <m>f</m> again to find the next value of <m>x</m>.</p>\n    \n    <p>This procedure works because moving horizontally to the diagonal (i.e., the line where <m>x_{n+1}=x_{n}</m>) makes your horizontal position match your vertical position, which was the output value of the previous step.</p>\n    \n    <p>Verify that this procedure works on the below graph by calculating <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>, starting with the initial condition <m>x_0=<ref>x0</ref></m>.

Here\'s one way to remember.\n    \n    <p>When you graph a function <m>f(x)</m> and you want to look up the value of, say <m>f(3)</m> from the graph, you start at <m>x=3</m> and move \n    <answer name=\'answer8\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     until you hit the graph.  The height of the graph at that point is the value of <m>f(3)</m>.  In other words, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer9\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>vertically</choice>\n    <choice>horizontally</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the natural thing to do when looking up function values.  When you are cobwebbing and moving vertically, you should always stop when you hit the \n    <answer name=\'answer10\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the function</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .</p>\n    \n    <p>On the other hand, moving \n    <answer name=\'answer11\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>horizontally</choice>\n    <choice>vertically</choice>\n    </answer>\n     is the strange part.  And, the new line that we plot with cobwebbing is the \n    <answer name=\'answer12\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the function</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .  If you associate those two strange additions together, you will remember that, during cobwebbing, when moving horizontally, you should stop when you hit the \n    <answer name=\'answer13\' inline=\'true\'>\n    <choice credit=\'1\'>graph of the diagonal</choice>\n    <choice>graph of the function</choice>\n    </answer>\n    .</p>\n    \n    \n    </li>\n    \n    \n    </ol>\n    \n    \n    <solution>\n    \n    \n    <ol>\n    \n    <li>\n    The equilibria are <m>E=-2,0,2</m>.\n    </li>\n    \n    <li>\n    <ol>\n    <li><m>x_0=1</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-1</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=3</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-3</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=3.75</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches -2</li>\n    <li><m>x_0=-3.75</m>.  <m>x_n</m> approaches 2</li>\n    </ol>\n    \n    </li>\n    \n    <li>\n    \n    </li>\n    \n    \n    </ol>\n    \n    </solution>\n    \n    \n    </problem>','2019-08-20 09:58:12','2019-08-14 15:21:45',0,'216d559cc3e42bc85d59ed3c99b098e8b69d1dddac88a5f06c0520c0fdefe332',0),
